# Phone Number Tracker

**Phone Number Tracker** is a Python-based tool that allows users to track and retrieve the location, carrier, and other geographical details of a given phone number. It leverages external APIs to gather accurate data and provides a simple interface for tracking phone numbers efficiently.

## Features

- Track phone numbers by retrieving details such as:
  - Country
  - Carrier
  - Location (city/state)
  - Timezone
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.
- Accurate information using external APIs.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed
- `phonenumbers` library
- Internet access (for API data retrieval)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/S11saurabh/Phone_Number_Tracker.git

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Phone_Number_Tracker

 3.  Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash

4. (Optional) For enhanced tracking features like timezone and carrier, you may need to set up an external API (like Googleâ€™s Geolocation API). Add the API key in the script if necessary.
